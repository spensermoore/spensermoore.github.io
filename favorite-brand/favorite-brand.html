			<h4>Which Brand?</h4>
			  <p>I have many brands that I resonate with in my life, but none of them are more significant to me than the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals are one of the oldest and most accomplished teams in Major League Baseball. Their roster is filled with All-Star players such as third baseman Nolan Arenado, first baseman and MVP recipient Paul Goldschmidt, and the newly acquired catcher Willson Contreras. They have had a big impact on my life, so therefore the aesthetic of their website and their overall environment will be the main inspiration for the design of my website </p>

				<h4>Why The St. Louis Cardinals?</h4>
				<p>The Cardinals website is very clean-cut. The site is organized, and the atmosphere is littered with the organization's theme. They use a sans serif font called “Helvetica Nue” that helps give off the clean feel of the website. The “clean-cut” feel is also supported by its images, which have enhanced focus on the players, with the colors of the team in the background. It uses the team's colors across the website, with it using red and white, along with some hints of navy-blue. They use white as the main background color. The red and navy-blue colors are used whenever they want to highlight something with significance to the user, such as news or the shop. This use of the colors and font inspires me to make something similar in that it appeals to the user’s visual likeness.</p>

			<h4>What do I Plan to Use?</h4>
			  <p>I really liked the simplicity of the font chosen by the Cardinals, so I am going to choose that font for my website as of right now. However, for the colors of the website, I am going to take somewhat of a different direction. Instead of just choosing colors that align with the historical colors of the organization, I am going to be choosing the colors that correlate with their jerseys. These colors include a soft red, a more prominent red, white, a cream color, and baby blue. The cream color will not be used as much since it is not as appealing as the other ones. However, I plan to follow what the Cardinals did and use white as a background color and have the reds and baby blue highlight the more significant areas of the website</p>

			<h4>My Logo Header</h4>
			  <p>For my logo header, I wanted to use something that was simple like the rest of the website will be. I found a logo header that is rectangular in shape, but also has prominent red and some black in there as well, just to make it stand out on the page. It was chosen so that it would pop out to the user’s visuals with the white background behind it.&nbsp;</p>
