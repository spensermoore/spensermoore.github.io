				<h4 class="text-center">INTRODUCTION</h4>
				<p>About three years ago, back when I was a junior in high school at Civic Memorial High School in Bethalto, I played on the varsity roster for the soccer team. This was around the end of October 2019, and we had just finished our best season in the school’s history with a record of 19-7. We were in the postseason and had made it all the way to the regional championship. Our opponent? Jerseyville. Jerseyville had always been one of our biggest rivals. They play in our conference, the Mississippi Valley Conference, and have consistently been a thorn in our side. But as we were warming up to play against them that night, I could tell that they were not messing around this time. They wanted that regional championship bad.&nbsp;</p>
				<h4 class="text-center">GAME ON&nbsp;</h4>
				<p>As the whistle blew and the game got underway, the game became increasingly intense. Pushes and shoves were traded back and forth, fouls were not being called (Jerseyville was always a physical team), and both sides were becoming frustrated with each other and the officials. After the whistle blew at halftime, the game's score was still tied 0-0. I had not played yet through this point in the game, that was until my coach, Derek Jarman, told me that he was sticking me in at right-back (defense). I was excited to get in and play, but I was still extremely nervous because of what the stakes were. This was not a game to make stupid mistakes in<br>

				<h4 class="text-center">STAYING IN THE FIGHT</h4>
				<p>After the 54th minute, Jerseyville’s striker, Andrew Kribbs, finally managed to put a goal behind us. We were all mentally frustrated at that point. And once one person gets down, everyone else follows. We had little to no motivation after being scored on first. Stupid errors were being made, and I was eventually subbed off because Jarman could tell that I was getting tired. One of my friends that I had played with for years and known even longer, Lucas Ambrose, got subbed in at center-mid (midfield). He found a way to slide the ball past Jerseyville’s goalie with just ten minutes left in the game. Everyone in the stands, on the bench, and on the field started roaring. He may have potentially saved our season.</p>

			<h4 class="text-center">LUKE COMING IN CLUTCH</h4>
			  <p>The initial 90 minutes (about 1 and a half hours) had gone by, and nobody had emerged victorious. This meant that we were going into overtime. In high school soccer, overtime consists of two 15-minute halves. Whoever has the best score once those halves are over, wins. After we went through those extra halves, neither side had scored another goal. This meant that we were going to have to go into penalty kicks. Through 5 shots for Jerseyville, they made 3. Through 4 shots for us, we had also made 3. This meant that we had a chance to seal the victory right then and there. The shooter – Lucas Ambrose. Lucas shot to the right side of the goal and made it in. Immediately, everyone rushed to the field. I ran straight to Lucas and hugged him (see lukehug.jpg). His heroics that night made us regional champions for the first time in over 20 years.</p>
